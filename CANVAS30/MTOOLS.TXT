 MidiTools Version 2.0 Overview
********************************

MidiTools is a set of MIDI utility programs for users of MS-DOS computers,
specially selected to complement the functions of the many fine sequencing 
and scoring packages on the market.  In particular, MidiTools can provide 
additional diagnostic, setup, and performance capabilities which may not be
available or are less convenient to use in more general software.  Support 
for a variety of MIDI interfaces, a simple user interface (with mouse 
functions and full help), and some new twists, combine to make MidiTools 
a useful addition for any MIDI musician.
