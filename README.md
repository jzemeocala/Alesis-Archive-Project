QControl 2.51 FULL
(An awesome yet abandoned sysex/patch editor made by Geoff Moehrke for the QS line of Alesis Synthesizers)
More info can be found at: https://web.archive.org/web/20060813154655if_/http://my.execpc.com/~gmoehrke/#Links


Simply unzip and install the demo
then copy the cracked exe over to the installation DIR; replacing the original QCD.exe

Also.....you MAY need to use an XP or older compatability mode...
Idk for sure though as I have only tried it so far on linux with WINE (works great that way BTW)


I have also included every extra sysex file and Expando Bank and qcard dump for the Alesis QS synths that I could find.
For flashing the Qcard dumps to PCMCIA cards I reccomend using the Included offical Alesis program "Sound Bridge"



PARTY ON Y'ALL
