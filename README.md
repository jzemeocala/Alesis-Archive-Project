After finally getting my hands on the QS8.1 SYNTH (30 years too late) I have come to realize that almost all of
the related software and SysEX files are virtually extinct... 

Therefore I have spent the past month collecting every single related SysEx file, "Bank/Program/Mix" file, Q-Card Image, and
Shareware/Demo/Trial Program that still exists (that I could find via archive.org backups of all the old forums) 




The QS8.1 truly is a beautiful Synth...
 
Released during the late-90s;
Right as the {Cost & Capabilities} of digital Synthesizers was FINALLY beginning to eclipse that of traditional Analog Synths.
It should come as no surprise that "The Doors" own Ray Manzarek was a faithful operator of this device during his final years.

HOWEVER.... despite all of the Complexities that the Alesis QS series is capable of... Us proud owners have been cursed by the most
Pitifully miniscule of screens + an insanely complex sound manipulation system.

This was apparently A common crux of late-90s digital synths.... and the de-facto solution back then was custom "PC-Based Patch Editors".
Several of which were made specifically (and independantly) for the Alesis QS series alone.

QControl, QS-Patch, Noize, Sound Bridge, Sound Tower, SoundDiver, Etc...
Many were made... Few still exist... Even fewer have creators that you can still contact

Each one had a different layout and slightly different capabilities but for the most part they all allowed for true LIVE control of the 
instrument via a computer.... Even now, with multiple programs archived/patched/cracked; I still have bareley wrapped my mind aroung
10% of what these things can do.

 
Those that were preserved were mostly distributed as "Shareware" or "Demos" or "Trials" (as was common back in the 32-bit era)


So... I Have decided to collect and (where applicable) crack whatever still remains....in the hopes of ensuring that future 
Alesis QS owners do not have to endure what I have had to. 


That is the purpose of this REPO....

QControl 2.51 FULL
(An awesome yet abandoned sysex/patch editor made by Geoff Moehrke for the QS line of Alesis Synthesizers)

Simply unzip and install the demo
then copy the cracked exe over to the installation DIR; replacing the original QCD.exe

Also.....you MAY need to use an XP or older compatability mode...
Idk for sure though as I have only tried it so far on linux with WINE (works great that way BTW)


PARTY ON Y'ALL
